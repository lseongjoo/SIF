Social Impact Factor (SIF)

Objective

1. Define Social Impact Factor (SIF) of products, service, people
2. Calculate SIF by collecting information from web including social network services.
3. Provide SIF via web interface

I haven't figured out how to define who and what to look for to start to with.

For now, searching web via Google AJAX API is provided.
